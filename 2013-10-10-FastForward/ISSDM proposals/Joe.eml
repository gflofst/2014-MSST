Carlos,
Here's the blurb on applying our SciHadoop / SIDR work to the Fast 
Forward work. In addition to this, I think we'd be wise to push the idea 
of extending Ceph to store portion of the HDF5 data set in RADOS, as 
objects. This would give us a leg up on making subsequent analytics more 
efficient and open the door for doing analytics in the storage system 
itself (QoS concerns permitting).

In looking at the Fast Forward proposal, I see several opportunities for 
integrating / expanding the SciHadoop / SIDR work into the IOD layer.

1) in-flight analytics. In looking at the FF documents and talking to 
those involved in the project, it seems, to me, that analytics being run 
in the IOD will likely need to be data-centric (processing whatever data 
arrives at the IOD with computations using the semantic knowledge 
packaged with the data). The will require rewriting existing analytic 
code into a form that looks similar to Hadoop Map tasks and our existing 
work in SciHadoop is directly applicable

2) In the scenario where IOD's can exchange data while performing 
analysis, the dynamic routing work in SIDR can be leveraged to make that 
communication more efficient and enable analysis to proceed more readily

3) Our work on efficient communication of intermediate data can reduce 
the amount of network traffic and memory consumed by data travelling 
from the IOD's to DAOS nodes (and between IODs)
