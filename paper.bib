  abstract = {The increasing fidelity of scientific simulations as they scale
  towards exascale sizes is straining the proven IO techniques championed
  throughout terascale computing. Chief among the successful IO techniques is
  the idea of collective IO where processes coordinate and exchange data prior
  to writing to storage in an effort to reduce the number of small, independent
  IO operations. As well as collective IO works for efficiently creating a data
  set in the canonical order, 3-D domain decompositions prove troublesome due
  to the amount of data exchanged prior to writing to storage. When each
  process has a tiny piece of a 3-D simulation space rather than a complete
  `pencil' or `plane', 2-D or 1-D domain decompositions respectively, the
  communication overhead to rearrange the data can dwarf the time spent
  actually writing to storage~\cite{MPIcollectiveFix}. Our approach seeks to
  transparently increase scalability and performance while maintaining both the
  IO routines in the application and the final data format in the storage
  system. Accomplishing this leverages both the Nessie~\cite{nessie} RPC
  framework and a staging area with staging services. Through these tools, we
  employ a variety of data processing operations prior to invoking the native
  API to write data to storage yielding as much as a 3$\times$ performance
  improvement over the native calls.}

  developer as applications scale to hundreds of thousands of processing cores.
  I/O processing is one area where extensive efforts are required to achieve
  acceptable performance and scalability. A successful approach to high
  performance I/O demonstrated by our group and others is to use select nodes
  for data staging, where data is evacuated from compute to staging nodes
  before being moved to the disk via the file system. This paper shows that I/O
  performance can be improved substantially by carefully managing how data
  staging is performed, and by enriching such I/O actions through additional
  "data services", lightweight abstractions for carrying out data processing
  such as transformation, reduction and scheduled storage. We evaluate data
  services on actual application codes within our data staging framework for
  asynchronous data movement, and we also describe the impact of resource
  management in synchronous environments.}

  (HEC) platforms can generate large volumes of data. For high performance
  storage and in order to be useful to science end users, such data must be
  organized in its layout, indexed, sorted, and otherwise manipulated for
  subsequent data presentation, visualization, and detailed analysis. In
  addition, scientists desire to gain insights into selected data
  characteristics `hidden' or `latent' in these massive datasets while data is
  being produced by simulations. PreDatA, short for Preparatory Data Analytics,
  is an approach to preparing and characterizing data while it is being
  produced by the large scale simulations running on peta-scale machines. By
  dedicating additional compute nodes on the machine as `staging' nodes and by
  staging simulations' output data through these nodes, PreDatA can exploit
  their computational power to perform select data manipulations with lower
  latency than attainable by first moving data into file systems and storage.
  Such intransit manipulations are supported by the PreDatA middleware through
  asynchronous data movement to reduce write latency, application-specific
  operations on streaming data that are able to discover latent data
  characteristics, and appropriate data reorganization and metadata annotation
  to speed up subsequent data access. PreDatA enhances the scalability and
  exibility of the current I/O stack on HEC platforms and is useful for data
  pre-processing, runtime data analysis and inspection, as well as for data
  exchange between concurrently running simulations.}

  abstract = {In the petascale era, the storage stack used by the extreme scale
  high performance computing community is fairly homogeneous across sites. On
  the compute edge of the stack, file system clients or IO forwarding services
  direct IO over an interconnect network to a relatively small set of IO nodes.
  These nodes forward the requests over a secondary storage network to a
  spindle-based parallel file system. Unfortunately, this architecture will
  become unviable in the exascale era. As the density growth of disks continues
  to outpace increases in their rotational speeds, disks are becoming
  increasingly cost-effective for capacity but decreasingly so for bandwidth.
  Fortunately, new storage media such as solid state devices are filling this
  gap; although not cost-effective for capacity, they are so for performance.
  This suggests that the storage stack at exascale will incorporate solid state
  storage between the compute nodes and the parallel file systems. There are
  three natural places into which to position this new storage layer: within
  the compute nodes, the IO nodes, or the parallel file system. In this paper,
  we argue that the IO nodes are the appropriate location for HPC workloads and
  show results from a prototype system that we have built accordingly. Running
  a pipeline of computational simulation and visualization, we show that our
  prototype system reduces total time to completion by up to 30%.}

  simulations need to generate large number of intermediate data sets that

  data. This generates some summarized, derived result that inspires some
  scientific insight. Traditionally, these routines use the storage array to
  persist the intermediate results between each step of the data analysis
  process. The volume and frequency of this data can be overwhelming compared
  with the available IO bandwidth on the machine. To handle this volume and
  frequency, current research efforts are determining how to move the storage
  of intermediate data from the storage array into the memory of the compute
  area. Then, the analysis routines are incorporated to create Integrated
  Application Workflows (IAWs). Data staging techniques require some mechanism
  to replace the semantics offered by the file system to control data movement
  and access. As part of an HPC-focused transaction services project, a first
  pass at a transactional metadata service for in compute area data storage is
  being developed.}

  abstract = {Current exascale computing projections suggest rather than a
  monolithic simulation running for the majority of the machine, a collection

  techniques may dynamically deploy or redeploy resources for optimal use of
  computing resources. These newly configured resources should only be used if
  they are successfully deployed. Our D2T system offers a mechanism to support
  these kinds of operations by providing database-like transactions with
  distributed servers and clients. Ultimately, with adequate hardware support,
  full ACID compliance is possible for the transactions. To prove the viability

  several challenges arising for such online analytics, including: how to
  efficiently run multiple analytics components on staging area resources
  providing them with the levels of end-to-end performance they need and how to
  manage staging resources when analytics actions change due to user or

  applications demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the approach.}

  large-scale groups. In this paper, we present SCAMP (Scalable Membership
  protocol), a novel peer-to-peer membership protocol which operates in a fully
  decentralized manner and provides each member with a partial view of the
  group membership. Our protocol is self-organizing in the sense that the size
  of partial views naturally converges to the value required to support a
  gossip algorithm reliably. This value is a function of the group size, but is
  achieved without any node knowing the group size. We propose additional
  mechanisms to achieve balanced view sizes even with highly unbalanced
  subscription patterns. We present the design, theoretical analysis, and a
  detailed evaluation of the basic protocol and its refinements. Simulation
  results show that the reliability guarantees provided by SCAMP are comparable
  to previous schemes based on global knowledge. The scale of the experiments
  attests to the scalability of the protocol.}

        For systems of such scale, efficient I/O is a significant challenge
        that cannot be solved using traditional approaches. In particular,
        general purpose parallel file systems that limit applications to
        standard interfaces and access policies do not scale and will likely
        be a performance bottleneck for many scientific applications.

        In this paper, we investigate the use of a ?lightweight? approach
        to I/O that requires the application or I/O-library developer to
        extend a core set of critical I/O functionality with the minimum
        set of features and services required by its target applications.
        We argue that this approach allows the development of I/O libraries
